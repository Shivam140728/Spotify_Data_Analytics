# Spotify Data Analytics Project
The Spotify Data Analytics Project utilizes Power BI to analyze and visualize Spotify's music streaming data, offering insights into user preferences, song popularity, and streaming trends. The project showcases the ability to transform raw data into actionable insights through interactive dashboards.

Key Features of the Project:

Data Integration:

Extracted data from sources like CSV files or Spotify's API.
Integrated and transformed data using Power Query for cleaning and structuring.
Exploratory Analysis:

Analyzed key metrics such as top-streamed songs, popular genres, and artist performance.
Identified trends in user behavior, including peak streaming times and regional preferences.
Interactive Visualizations:

Created visually appealing dashboards with interactive charts, slicers, and filters.
Displayed metrics like song popularity (by plays), genre-wise distribution, and audio feature analysis (e.g., tempo, energy, danceability).
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

Highlighted metrics such as the most-streamed artist, total play counts, and year-on-year growth in streaming.
User Segmentation:

Segmented listeners based on their preferences, such as favorite genres or frequent listening hours.
Business Insights:

Provided actionable insights to improve playlist recommendations and promotional strategies.
This project demonstrates expertise in Power BI, data cleaning (Power Query), and the ability to create data-driven stories through dynamic visualizations.
